LOADING_TIP_1;“There was no word for heaven or for earth, for sea or sky. All that existed was silence. Then the Voice of the Maker rang out the first Word and His Word became all that might be.” -- Threnodies 5:1–8;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_2;“And so is the Golden City blackened with each step you take in my Hall. Marvel at perfection, for it is fleeting. You have brought Sin to Heaven and doom upon all the world.” -- Threnodies 8:13;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_3;“Idealism is our stock in trade, Lambert. A religion without ideals is tyranny.” -- The Divine Justinia V;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_4;“The people fear what we can do, but to use that fear to bludgeon us into submission is wrong! And they do it with our blessing!” -- Anders;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_5;“Those who oppose thee shall know the wrath of heaven. Field and forest shall burn, the seas shall rise and devour them, ...they shall cry out to their false gods, and find silence.” -- Andraste 7:19;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_6;“The ancient Tevinters did not originally consider Blood Magic a school of its own. Rather, they saw it as a means to achieve greater power in any school of magic." -- First Enchanter Josephus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_7;"I detest this notion that the Veil is some manner of invisible "curtain" that separates the world of the living from the world of the spirits...think of the Veil, instead, as opening one's eyes.” -- Senior Enchanter Minero;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_8;“No traveller to the Fade can fail to spot the Black City. It is one of the few constants of that ever-changing place.” -- From Beyond the Veil: Spirits and Demons, by Enchanter Mirdromel;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_9;“You know very well, Shale, that demons do not create everything in the Fade. They set the stage, as it were, and we fill it with our own dreams and nightmares.” -- Wynne;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_10;“There is no geography in the Fade. Place and time are far less important than concepts and symbols.” -- Fiona;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_11;“The study of the Fade is as old as humankind. For so long as men have dreamed, we have walked its twisting paths, sometimes catching a glimpse of the city at its heart.” --  First Enchanter Josephus.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_12;“We Tranquil are vital. The young and old may stare at me, ill at ease, but they would be worse off without me. They may think me a failure, but there is no horror for me now.” -- Tranquil Eddin the Meek;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_13;“Magic is a cancer in the heart of our land, just as it was in the time of Andraste. And like her, we are left with no choice but to purify it with fire and blood.” -- Meredith Stannard;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_14;“They found us mixing freely with our families, training female mages in the traditions of the seers, and denounced us as apostates." -- First Enchanter Rivella, slain in Dairsmuid, 9:40 Dragon;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_15;“To anyone who doubts the wickedness of blood magic, I say: With your own hands, strike down the corpses of your own brothers who have fallen in battle to a maleficar, then we may discuss morality.” -- Knight-Commander Benedictus;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_16;“And so it comes to me at last. Soon I shall see the land through your eyes, creature. You shall be mine, body and soul.” -- a Rage demon during a Harrowing;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_17;“A spirit trapped within a tree, no mouth to scream or eyes to see. A cage of bark, a prison of wood. A thing of rage where nature stood.” -- The Grand Oak's Riddle;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_18;“The demons of the Fade are jealous of the world they sense across the Veil. They constantly push against the boundaries, and when they finally cross over, they attempt to possess the first living creature they see.” -- On Demons;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_19;“This was a fearsome creature of the Fade, but as I spoke with her I slowly came to realize that this Desire Demon was merely as misunderstood as we mages are, ourselves.” -- Former Senior Enchanter Maleus;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_20;“There, perched atop the spire of the village chantry, stood the mage. But he was human no longer.We had forced it to this, I realized; the mage had made this pact, given himself over to the demon to survive our assault.”;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_21;“There's only two things a noble will step aside for: Paragons and angry brontos.” -- Dwarven saying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_22;“We are the Children of the Stone. She supports us, shelters us, offers us the most priceless gifts of the earth. The worthy return to her embrace in death, becoming Ancestors.” As told by Shaper Czibor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_23;“They treat us like dust, tell us we're cursed. How else are we supposed to live? We got nothing!” -- Kalah Brosca, Casteless Dwarf;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_24;“You can try, but you'll never get it off you. Dust town, it sticks to the skin... You don't bleed red enough for them, and nothing's gonna change that.” -- Kalah Brosca, Casteless Dwarf;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_25;“It is an awe–inspiring sight, a great city of stone standing within a vast cavern, poised over a sea of molten lava.-- On the city of Orzammar";;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_26;“What is a matter of choice for most human folk is dictated entirely by birth for dwarves. No one may become a smith who was not born to Smith Caste parents, daughters inherit the caste of their mother, while sons inherit the caste of their#father.”;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_27;“Never surrender. Dwarvish blood may be lukewarm, but vital as ore” -- Paragon Lynchcar;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_28;“In Orzammar, things are solved quickly and with as much bloodshed as we can stand... and then a little bit more.” -- Nalthur;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_29;“It allowed me to forge a man of steel or stone, as flexible and clever as any soldier. As an army, they were invincible. But I told no one the cost...” -- Caridin, on the Golems;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_30;“The Memories tell us that our kingdom once reached far beneath the mountains, and that the thaigs were almost beyond counting.” -- Shaper Czibor;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_31;“200 years! Kal Sharok lives, you Stone-forsaken deep lords. There is no greater hatred than a brother at your throat!” -- Dwarven Graffiti;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_32;“Yes, Stone's greetings friend. You will fight ceaselessly in The Legion of the Dead.” -- Motto of the Legion of the Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_33;“We die in the eyes of our brothers so we can fight without fear. It offers redemption for the greatest sacrifice.” -- Unknown Legionnaire of the Dead;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_34;“Without an end there can be no peace” -- Flemeth;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_35;"You are required to do nothing, least of all believe. Shut one's eyes tight or open one's arms wide, either way, one's a fool." -- Flemeth;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_36;“I'm not interested in stories. I came to hear the truth.” -- Cassandra Pentaghast;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_37;“Existence is a choice. There is no chaos in the world, only complexity. Knowledge of the complex is wisdom. From wisdom of the world comes wisdom of the self. Mastery of the self is mastery of the world."-- The Qun, Canto 1;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_38;“They are bound by their being. Asit tal-eb. It is to be. For the world and the self are one. Existence is a choice. A self of suffering, brings only suffering to the world. It is a choice, and we can refuse it.” -- The Qun, Canto 4;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_39;“Either you have an enviable memory, or a pitiable life, to know nothing of regret.” -- Sten of the Beresaad;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_40;“Before them I was nothing. I was a slave. My parents sold me into it. The Qunari gave me refuge, a purpose, and a name: Tallis.” -- Tallis;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_41;“One converted Seheran reported pity for those who refused to embrace the Qun... "For all my life, I followed the Maker wherever his path led me", he wrote, "but in the Qun I have found the means to travel my own path".” --  Sister Petrine;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_42;“Qunari warriors in glittering steel armour carved through armies with ease. Their cannons, the likes of which our ancestors had never seen, reduced city walls to rubble in a matter of seconds.” -- Sister Petrine on the First Qunari War;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_43;“Arishok, Arigena, Ariqun. Pillars of the Qunari, of the nation that must be.” -- Arishok;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_44;“In War, Victory. In Peace, Vigilance. In Death, Sacrifice.” -- Motto of the Grey Wardens;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_45;“Join us in the shadows where we stand vigilant. Join us as we carry the duty that can not be forsworn. And should you perish, know that your sacrifice will not be forgotten. And that one day we shall join you.” -- Words of The Joining;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_46;“I watched from across the battlefield as Garahel struck the final blow against the Archdemon and a great wave of energy surged out from the beast. Even at my distance, the force struck me like the blast of some great storm.” -- Grey Warden Prosper;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_47;“The Maker smiles sadly on his Grey Wardens, so the Chantry says, as no sacrifice is greater than theirs.” -- Paraphrasing of a popular saying;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_48;“Men and women from every race, warriors and mages, barbarians and kings... the Grey Wardens sacrificed everything to stem the tide of darkness... and prevailed.” -- Duncan, head of the Grey Wardens in Ferelden;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_49;“Halamshiral, "the end of the journey," was our capital, built out of the reach of the humans. But it was not to last. The Chantry first sent missionaries into the Dales, and then, when those were thrown out, templars. -- Keeper Gisharel;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_50;“We are the Dalish: keepers of the lost lore, walkers of the lonely path. We are the last of the Elvhenan, and never again shall we submit.” -- The Oath of the Dales;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_51;“My home is out here, in the forest with the trees and animals. I learned to listen to them, and they taught me well.” -- Aneirin, Dalish mage;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_52;“In time, the human empires will crumble. We have seen it happen countless times. Until then, we wait... we raise Halla and build Aravels. We try to keep hold of the old ways, to relearn what was forgotten.” -- Keeper Gishariel;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_53;“Before the ages were named or numbered, our people were glorious and eternal and never-changing. Like the great oak tree, they were constant in their traditions, strong in their roots, and ever reaching for the sky." -- Keeper Gishariel;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_54;“At Shartan's word, the sky Grew black with arrows. At Our Lady's, ten thousand swords Rang from their sheaths, A great hymn rose over Valarian Fields gladly proclaiming: Those who had been slaves were now free.” -- Shartan 10:1;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#LOADING_TIP_55;“Mostly the old ways are gone. Each generation forgets a little more of the old tongue, a little more of the traditions. And the few things we keep become simple habits, the meaning long since faded.” -- Sarethia, Hahren of the Highever Alienage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#LOADING_TIP_56;“There have been alienages for as long as elves and shems have lived in the same lands. Here, we're among family. We look out for each other. Here, we do what we can to remember the old ways.” -- Sarethia, Hahren of the Highever Alienage;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_57;“So we should take everything the humans say at face value? We're all lazy, vulgar, thieves then? That's what they say, isn't it?”-- Shianni;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_58;“We may be mere insects, Grand Duke, but so are wasps. A wise man avoids poking their nest.”-- Briala, Elven spymaster of Empress Celene I;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_59;“Like dragons they fly, glory upon wings. Like dragons they savage, fearsome pretty things.”-- Unknown poet, written of humans shortly before the fall of the Dales;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_60;Swooping is bad.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_61;“Varric will make it a good story, I'm sure.” -- Merrill;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_62;At the height of its power, the Tevinter Imperium stretched over much of Thedas, uniting the known world. The blood of elven slaves and humans alike ran down Imperial altars.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_63;After the First Blight, the Imperium began to tear itself apart from within, throngs of angry and disillusioned citizens doing what centuries of opposing armies could not.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_64;“Those who had been cast down, the demons who would be gods, began to whisper to men from their tombs within the earth. And the men of Tevinter heard.” -- Threnodies 8:21-27;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_65;There were seven Old Gods, great winged dragons that were said to rule over the ancient world. The Chantry maintains that they are responsible for the original sin, that they turned humanity away from its true creator through deceit.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_66;The Imperium today is a Magocracy. The magisters form a council of the most powerful mages in the kingdom - they convene in Minrathous and hold dominion over all magic in the land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_67;Every child has been brought up on stories of Tevinter as it is now: a decadent nation, ruled by the Archon and his court of Magisters — great, and no doubt corrupt, mage-lords.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_68;The kingdom of Ferelden is the southernmost civilized nation in Thedas - although some scholars dispute that claim to civilization.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_69;“Fereldans are a puzzle. They are the coarse, wilful, dirty, disorganized people who somehow gave rise to our prophet, ushered in an era of enlightenment, and toppled the greatest empire in history.” -- Empress Celene I;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_70;To their neighbours, Ferelden seems utterly chaotic. Unlike other monarchies, power does not descend from our throne. Rather, it rises from the support of the freeholders. The king is, in essence, the most powerful of the Teyrns.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_71;Known for their intelligence and loyalty, Mabari are more than mere weapons or status symbols: The hounds choose their masters, and pair with them for life.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_72;Orlais presents a veneer of opulence, but the aristocracy are committed to a system of social one-upmanship they call the Game. Sprawling receptions delight friend and foe, while bards strike from shadow.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_73;“All the nobility play the Grand Game, as it is known, whether they wish to or not. No gentle game, this. More blood has been drawn as a result of the Grand Game than any war the Orlesians have fought.” -- Bann Teoric;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_74;“The Orlesians' right to rule stems directly from the Maker. There exists neither the concept of rule by merit nor the slightest notion of rebellion. -- Bann Teoric;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_75;“We let nobles decide who to blame. We are just the enablers of the game.” -- Former Bard, Leliana;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_76;“I remember, as a child, watching a column of chevaliers parade down a wide avenue in Val Royeaux. Dashing knights on armored steeds, pennants snapping in the breeze. I have never forgotten.” -- Mother Laeticia;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_77;“A good war unites the empire.” -- Grand Duke Gaspard de Chalons;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_78;Navarre is filled with artistry, from the statues of heroes that litter the streets to the glittering golden College of Magi in Cumberland. Perhaps nowhere is more astonishing than the vast necropolis outside Nevarra City.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_79;Unlike most other followers of Andraste, the Nevarrans do not burn their dead. Instead, they carefully preserve the bodies and seal them in elaborate tombs.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_80;The Free Marches are not a kingdom, nor even a nation. People from that region dislike even being lumped together as "Marchers." Rather, they are a collection of independent city-states united only when it suits them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_81;The Grand Tourney is the oldest, and perhaps only, tradition of the Free Marches. On those rare, one-in-a-thousand days when a Contest of Arms may be called, every Marcher unites in fellowship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_82;“Antiva City... Where they say every man is a poet or a merchant prince, and treachery is the coin of the realm.” -- Alistair;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_83;“Antiva is a terrible place. All full of assassins and... Antivans.” -- Duncan;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_84;The line of kings in Antiva has remained unbroken for two and a half thousand years - it is simply that nobody pays any attention to them whatsoever. The nation is ruled in truth by a collection of merchant princes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_85;The fame of the Antivan Crows is such that Antiva keeps no standing army: No king is willing to order his troops to assault her borders, and no general is mad enough to lead such an invasion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_86;The Raiders of the Waking Sea is the common name given to an association of Antivan pirates called the Felicisima Armada.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_87;The Rivaini refuse to be parted from their seers, wise women who are in fact hedge mages. The Chantry prohibition against such magical practices violates millennia of local tradition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_88;The Anderfels are a land of shocking extremes. It is the most desolate place in all the world, for two Blights have left the steppes so completely devoid of life that corpses cannot even decay there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_89;The Anders, too, are a people of extremes: The most devout priests and the most deadly soldiers, the poorest nation in the world and the most feared.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_90;The murmurs are true--the First Warden is often embroiled in the politics of the Anderfels and has little opportunity to consider worldly matters.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
LOADING_TIP_91;The word "Thedas" is Tevinter in origin, originally used to refer to lands that bordered the Imperium. As the Imperium lost its stranglehold on conquered nations, more and more lands became Thedas.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
